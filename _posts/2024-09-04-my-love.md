i love seeing your smile. the smile that i want to protect. i swear no one gonna take your smile from you

i'll fight anyone who hurt you. your smile is so angelic that i think "wow, she love me? really? do i deserve her?". damn, i fall in love with you all over again.

you're my everything, my priority. my highest priority. you're my world, my home. i'll always come back to you, no matter what. i dont want to hurt you. i'll protect you. you're mine, i'm yours. i love you

i love you more than your moodiness, more than your sensitivity, more than your bad and good day, more than everything in the world. i wish you the happiness, always. i'm sorry i always make mistakes. i swear i'm trying, for you and for us
