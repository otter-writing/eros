we have an argument today. but as always, we can handle it in the end. you're the fire, and i'm the water. so, we can work it out. i swear i'm not leaving you whatever the condition is. i love you.

you know what? i realize that i can handle my emotions well when i'm with you. i don't know the reason is. but, whenever you mood is bad, i only take few minitues to think clearly and do the comforting stuff. in the end, i know that i love you so much that i hold back my ego, to keep you.
