today i accidentally hurt you. i feel really bad. i didn't mean any of it. i hurt you over and over again even though i try my best to treat you right.

i will do my best in the future.

i love you so muchl. it kills me when you feels unsafe around me

gosh.

i'm so stupid.

how f i let out my impulsiveness.

dumbass.

i promise to myself to never do anything to hurt you again. i wish you can always be patien with me

please don't leave. i love you.

i don't know what can i do now except saying sorry and trying to comfort you. i'm not tired, i know myself but i really feels like i'd rather hurt myself than hurting you. should i SH again? but you will hate me and blame yourself (which i know it's not your fault)

i don't know what i should do

\---

i love you too deep. you own me

i will be the person who will love you unconditionally and love you right. you deserve it. you deserver the best version of me. i'll prove myself to you. just wait, my love. i love you
